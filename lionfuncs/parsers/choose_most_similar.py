    Choose the most similar word from a list of correct words.

    This function compares the input word against a list of correct words
    using a similarity scoring function, and returns the most similar word.

    Args:
        word: The word to compare.
        correct_words_list: The list of correct words to compare against.
        score_func: A function to compute the similarity score between two
            words. Defaults to jaro_winkler_similarity.

    Returns:
        The word from correct_words_list that is most similar to the input
        word based on the highest similarity score, or None if the list is
        empty.
